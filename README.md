# CliniCool
Interview application test.

CliciCool was written as coding assessment for job interview March 2016. I got the job.
These were the instructions, along with the PowerPoint file showing the desired interface.
The code has been updated for Swift 3.

"The following are the requirements for the iOS assessment:

The code should be written in Swift programming language.

The application should read from the clinicList.json and store securely the (Name, id) of each clinic type. To store it securely a KeyChain can be use.

The application should display each clinic using a Collection View as shown in the mockup.

When the user clicks on a particular clinic a detail view is shown (per mockup).

The views should work in landscape and portrait mode. Might need autolayout.

On the clinic detail view upon press of the See On Map button a Map View is shown. 

The application should be using the MVC pattern. "
